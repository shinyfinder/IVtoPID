<p align="center">This applet allows you to find the PID of your Pokemon from 
its <b>IVs and Nature</b>. Remember that all <b>legendary Pokemon</b> and all 
Pokemon caught from <b>Diamond and Pearl</b> should have their PID created using
<b>Method 1</b>, while other non-legendary Pokemon caught from Ruby, Sapphire, 
Emerald, Fire Red or Leaf Green can have their PID created using <b>Method 2</b> 
or <b>Method 3</b>. See accompanying article for more information. You can also 
use this applet to check for the legality or otherwise of your unbred Pokemon.</p>
